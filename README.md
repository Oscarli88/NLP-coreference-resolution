Coreferene resolution with Java

I use the Standford CoreNLP to the the corefence resolution, a sysytem with the best performance for the present. Well, this model performs really good with Anaphora, but performs really bad when it comes to cases such as Cataphora, Split antecedents or Coreferring noun phrases.
In my code, after identifying the corefence, I will replace them with the original representation.
